# Risk Analysis

## Overview
As a first world country, is the United States a safer place to live than a third world country? Have we developed a false sense of security since there are no active warlike conflicts in this country? Is it true that developing countries are less "civilized" and that there exists higher violent crime rates? This analysis will delve into the science of info graphics to present a detailed yet simple explanation of what crime is like our world. 

## Hypothesis
Homicide rates are not affected by either the first or third world status of a country.

## Data
The primary datasource for the project will be the homicides data from the UN Statistics Database. The visualization of the choropleth was made possible due to the shape file created by _Bjorn Sandvik at thematicmapping.org_. The latest version of his shape file can be downloaded at http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php. If the link is broken the shapefile can also be accessed from the *data/mapdata* folder

## Execution
Start the R interpreter and source _main.R_. Your browser will open a new tab with the a page loaded from the Shiny server. 

## Issues
The choropleth map generator is extremely slow... Go make a cup of coffee and hug a hobo.
