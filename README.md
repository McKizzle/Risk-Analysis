# Risk Analysis

## Overview
As a first world country, is the United States a safer place to live than a third world country? Have we developed a false sense of security since there are no active warlike conflicts in this country? Is it true that developing countries are less "civilized" and that there exists higher violent crime rates? This analysis will delve into the science of info graphics to present a detailed yet simple explanation of what crime is like our world. 

## Hypothesis
Crime rates are not affected by either the first or third world status of a country.

## Data
The datasets that will be visualized will consist of crime statistics from but not limited to; The Bureau of Justice Statistics, Eurostat, Uniform Crime Reporting Program, and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.
